### Description
A short description of what the task force does (i.e. the problem statement or scope).

_Example:_  
_Members of the Carpentries community contribute to lessons in a variety of ways, from creating them to maintaining repositories. However, there are not well-defined processes for recognizing the diversity of these contributions in official lesson publications or even when lessons should be officially published. Recognition serves to motivate contributors, highlight the work being done within the community, and provide opportunities for professional development for community members. Finally, the skills and responsibilities required for roles in lesson publication may be understood within the Carpentries but not to people outside the community (such as hiring committees)._

### Objectives
The overall objective(s) or purpose of the task force, i.e. that the task force aims to achieve. 

_Example:_  
_The objective of this task force is to develop guidelines for recognition of contributions to Carpentries lessons in official lesson publications, as well as a process for regular lesson publications. These guidelines will include methodological approaches (e.g. how to quantify contributions, assign authorship on published lessons, and determine when a lesson is ready for a new publication) and technical approaches (e.g. how to collect and store data on various modes of contribution). Community input on these goals will come in the form of an initial survey and the recruitment of Task Force members._

### Deliverables
Description of the planned deliverables, e.g. documents or other outputs from the work. These deliverables should be linked to from this charter upon the project completion and the completion date of the task force should also be updated. 

_Example:_ 
1. _A document describing:_
    - _Types of contributions that deserve lesson authorship or other acknowledgement_
    - _A minimum threshold of contribution that constitutes authorship, including the recency of contributions_
    - _A method for determining authorship order in official lesson publications_
2. _A document describing:_
    - _A type of schedule for lesson publications (regularly timed or milestone-based)_
    - _Methods for determining lesson publication schedules_
    - _Whose responsibility it is to track progress and initiate publication_
3. _A blog post describing the conclusions reached by the task force_
4. _A document describing a communications plan for informing relevant community members (maintainers, contributors, lesson developers, CAC members) about the lesson publication plan._
